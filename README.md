# MCMLP
A machine learning algorithm based on the integration of multiple sub-models into a strong model, which can protect the data privacy of users of each sub-model.

The project is developed based on [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and uses the metal fatigue strength data set provided by [NIMS](https://www.nims.go.jp/eng/).

The code of the project is in the src directory, and the data is stored in the data directory.
